# 🔐 Password Checker Console App

A simple C# console application that simulates a secure password checker with:

- Password validation
- Limited login attempts
- Lockout mechanism
- Custom support contact

## 🧠 How It Works

- The user has 3 chances to enter the correct password (`Sl123`).
- After 3 failed attempts, the account is locked.
- A support number is displayed for further assistance.
